## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Tooling framework
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Testing framework
- [Vue Test Utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/) - Testing library for Vue3
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - JS linting
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - CSS linting

### What I learned

I hadn't used Vue for a while and decided to brush up and learn how to use and test Vue3 components. 

### Continued development

As always the focus is on clean, maintainable codebases alongside near-pixel perfect design. I am starting to get the hang of using the PerfectPixel plugin and have used it as a default going forward
with my projects. I have also began to write more descriptive git commits to make each commit more understandable. The next thing to work on would be committing small chunks instead of multiple chunks at once.
